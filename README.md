# Sampatheme
Small compilation of features of Beamer themes I've found online. 

This is inspired on work of [Karl Broman] (https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2013/10/07/better-looking-latexbeamer-slides/) , [Matthias Vogelgesang] (https://github.com/matze/mtheme) and this presentation on [Lucidchart] ( https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2016/12/07/how-to-make-a-presentation-in-latex/).
